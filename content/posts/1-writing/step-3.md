title: 1.3 Plot points and word count

## Theory

I like to use K.M. Weiland's articles on character arcs to plot each character out. While the breakthrough assumes a single character whose development is closely tied to the various plot points, it can be tweaked to make the arcs both shorter and longer (I have one character arc whose 1st plot point coincides with the 3rd plot point of the novel).

If you used the article on structure I introduced in 1.1, you should revisit the structure to map it to your manuscript. If you didn't, read it through and plot based on what you have. As with the prior, it assumes a single large arc and doesn't account for subplots, so tweak it with the needs of your story. After all, there's nothing stating that the three plot points needs to be connected to the larger arc.

## Practice

Consider what word count you're aiming for, and space out your points accordingly. If a point doesn't exist, just add a placeholder scene for it. After that, it's a matter of evaluating what scenes are missing. How do existing scenes need to be reworked to help the narrative? The prior step was mainly about deleting scenes, and this one is back to the drawing board. You may not touch every scene, and that's fine, but you should at that point have a nice plan on how to get the structure of your story pinned down.
