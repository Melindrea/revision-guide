## Theory
Stories are meant to be read out loud. Word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence, scene-by-scene, chapter-by-chapter: ensure that you are using the appropriate word, etc. Are you using weak verbs with (or without!) adverbs? Are you using convoluted synonyms to avoid a verb + adverb?

### Own your words
I was unsure on where to put this tangent, but this seems the fitting place for a few disjointed thoughts on what the right word is.

First, the frenemy of any writer: the thesaurus. There's nothing wrong with using a thesaurus to find the perfect word, however you shouldn't go overboard with it. Ensure that you pick words that you (and your PoV!) understand and can use in a sentence. Do you actually know how to use **pernickety**? And would your character use it in dialogue or narrative? If so, go ahead. If you don't, either find a better word, or research the meaning, synonyms **and etymology** of it before you use it.

Next up, problematic words. This is a lot harder, and goes back to knowing the meaning and the etymology of the words you're using, to do your best to avoid furthering bad stereotypes. As an example, let us go with a series of words that all have some meaning of "swindle".

* Gyp, gip, jip: probably from the term gypsy--which is an often offensive term for a member of the Romani people--meaning to swindle someone. It's based on the stereotype that Roma are swindlers
* Jew: etymology fairly clear, meaning to defraud someone
* Welsh: once again, etymology fairly clear, meaning is to "swindle by defaulting on a debt"

All three of these words are xenophobic, derived from negative stereotypes of a particular group of people. If you use them willy-nilly, you will be furthering those stereotypes, and at least one of your readers are likely to react negatively. Those kind of words are what's referred to as "microaggressions".

Language is powerful, and it's been used to shape a narrative for many years against groups that are so-called outside the norm. Look up your words, ensure you know and understand them.

## Practice

Read it again and again. Test the rhythm, check your words, find the perfect word at the perfect place for every bit of the story. If you have someone who'd listen, that is immensely helpful.
