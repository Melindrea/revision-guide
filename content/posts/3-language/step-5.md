### Practice

I like to use Word's spelling and grammar check, so I compile the document and go through it in Word. It's also a good idea to print it out and go to town with a red marker. You'll see different things when you have it in a different format.

The Hemingway App is a decent text-analysing tool that you can either try for free online, or buy for the desktop. As of yet I've mainly used the online tool. Now, keep in mind that everything that the app does is *give suggestions*. Not even Hemingway would've "passed" using this app! However, to me it is useful getting an overview of the complexity of your sentences.
