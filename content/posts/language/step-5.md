## Practice

### Grammar/Spelling

Since I use Scrivener, I compile the document for each of these steps and then transfer the changes back to Scrivener before the next step.

Scrivener has its own spellchecker, so hopefully some has been caught while you've been working.

* Start with your trusty word processor, whichever it is
* Print the document and go to town with a red marker. It's easier to catch errors in a new format
* Google Docs uses Google Search to do spellchecking, so it's a good third option

After that, you should have minimised the number of errors your copyeditor finds, which will be cheaper for you in the long run.

The Hemingway App is a decent text-analysing tool that you can either try for free online, or buy for the desktop. As of yet I've mainly used the online tool. Now, keep in mind that everything that the app does is *give suggestions*. Not even Hemingway would've "passed" using this app! However, to me it is useful getting an overview of the complexity of your sentences.
