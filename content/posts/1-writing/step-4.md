### Theory

The Scene-Sequel pattern explained originally by Dwight V. Swain, but that has been expanded on in quite a few posts across the years. I'm going to summarise the technique, and recommend my resources for further explanations.

A **Scene** (note the capital S) is a time of action. It comes with a **Goal** (something the PoV wants), a **Conflict** (an obstacle to what the PoV wants) and a **Disaster** (something that stops the goal from being achieved in this scene). I don't fully agree with the idea that you should never allow a PoV to gain victories, but that's why these are suggestions.

Example on how to build a Scene:

* Goal: Our PoV *Dana* wants to ask their neighbour *Jayne* on a date.
* Conflict: *Dana* is shy and *Jayne* is oblivious to *Dana's* intentions.
* Disaster: When *Dana* finally gets the courage to ask, they accidentally stumble over *Jayne's* cat, and the mood disappears.

A **Sequel** deals with the fallout from the prior scene, though if the disaster is big enough, it might take several Sequel-scenes to deal with all of it. It needs a **Reaction** (PoV dealing with the disaster), a **Dilemma** (something with no good options), and **Decision** (the PoV makes a choice that sets up the new goal).

Example on how to build a Sequel:

* Reaction: *Dana* is beating themselves up over their stupidity and clumsiness.
* Dilemma: Either *Dana* stops pursuing *Jayne*, at which point they won't ever date, or *Dana* continues, at which point they risk making a fool (if only in their own mind) of themselves again.
* Decision: Maybe *Dana* decides to instead flirt with someone else, or to ask *Jayne* to the big party on Saturday. Either or, we have the making for a new Scene.

### Practice
For each scene that you've kept (or added) in the prior structuring, note whether they're a Scene or a Sequel. Every Scene needs to have at least one Sequel, though it may have more than one. Check that the Scene has a Goal/Conflict/Disaster (or if, failing that, there's a good reason why it doesn't), and that the combined Sequels have Reaction/Dilemma/Decision.

Does it matter what plotline the Goals/etc are based on? Not really. This is about writing exciting Scenes followed by introspection, to start the process of pacing and keep the reader wtih you to the very end. In this step you'll also write the scenes you plotted in the prior step.

### Tips & Tricks

If you use Scrivener, you can:

* Add Keywords to each scene to show what Character Arcs show up, what Plotlines, what Characters, what Settings
* Use custom meta data to mark whose PoV it is, if it's a Scene or Sequel, what the Goals (etc) are
