### Theory
Narrative voice is like the character voice in the sense that it's filtered through that character's experience, but separate in the sense that it's not what comes out of the character's voice, but how they see the world.

For example, my fashion designer Katja is likelier to notice the cut of someone's clothes, while her girlfriend Sia is likelier to notice the colours. To Belinda, the world is a painful reminder of her trauma, and the classically educated Andrej is a romantic at heart.

This both comes down to how they'd structure sentences, what they would notice in a scene, how they would notice it, and word choice. What colour is her dress, is it red or oxblood? For that matter, is it a dress, or is it a gown?


### Practice
For each PoV, go through the wording and sentence structure and make sure that everything they notice is described in the way they would, and that the sensory impressions match what they would perceive.

If there is a single PoV, you have a bit more freedom (though it should be consistent), but if you have several PoVs, they need to be distinct. Given a paragraph, it should be immediately obvious who we're seeing this through.
