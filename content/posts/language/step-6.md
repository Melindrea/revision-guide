## Theory
What gives; we're repeating this? Yes! You've changed a whole bunch of things with grammar, changing up heaviness of sentences and reworked the narrative voice, so your pretty MRUs have probably become all messed up.

This time, however, you're also keeping an eye on the pacing, so you don't mess that up. I also recommend printing it out and work it over with highlighters to evaluate the senses, and heighten them even more if necessary. Remember, deep Point of View.
