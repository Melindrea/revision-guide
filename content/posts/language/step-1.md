### Theory

Confession time! Of the sections in this rundown, I had the hardest time with this one. Probably because unlike the others that are subjective but tangible, this is subjecting and intangible. A list of mixed reading material follows in the resources section.

To quote Chuck Wendig:

> Theme is you saying something with your fiction

He goes on to explain/suggest that theme is not a single word, it's not a logline, it's not a question. It's the proven thesis, and motifs are part of the arguments to support it. It doesn't need to be a *nice* conclusion ("a woman needs a man in her life" is equally valid to "friendship is the strongest force"), but it needs to take a stand, and take a side.

Over to motifs as supporting the theme. They are:

> a recurring subject, item, idea, etc., especially in a literary, artistic, or musical work.

An example from classical music is the *ide fixe* of the theme signifying the artist's beloved, in Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique. Through five movements, we pick up the same melody, including the grotesque, corrupted melody in the fifth movement, where the artist is in Hell.

If your theme is "time heals all wounds", then maybe a motif can be the seasons: starting in winter when all is dead, and moving into spring and summer. Or maybe signifying this with birds, or bugs, or something like that. You will have to look through your own manuscript to see what your theme and motifs are.

### Practice

1. Seeing the story as a whole, what does it say/prove? If it doesn't say anything, what do you want it to say? Think of it in terms such as "X leads to Y", or "X wins over Y": a strong statement that your story should prove without a doubt. Oh, and no. You really don't need to have a preachy theme, just own what your fiction is saying.
2. Go through your scenes and figure out if you have any recurring motifs that you could expand on. If not, is there anything that would deepen the story?
3. Once again go through the scenes, and figure out how you want to expand motifs, or for that matter remove ones that you feel aren't adding anything to the story.
