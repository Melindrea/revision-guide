    <p>This is how I do things. Every step is based on how I work and what my drafts look like. It&rsquo;s very likely that not all these steps will jibe with your way of working. It&rsquo;s even possible that you will not be able to use even a single step here, though if that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ve learned quite a few new ways that don&rsquo;t work for you. That&rsquo;s progress in itself!</p>
<p>I recommend you to read through the guide to get a feeling for it before you start using it, since part of what I like with my process is the division of tasks. For me, it&rsquo;s easier to go through a section several times, with different focus for each time, than to catch <strong>everything</strong> in a single go.</p>
<p>My first draft is generally cohesive with only minor changes in plot/motivations, but sparse in details. I occasionally joke that I can do scenery, dialogue or character motivation, but not two at the same time. So, if your 1st draft is a jumbled mess of changing point of views, changing directions, you&rsquo;ll probably need to start at a different step. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that either of our technique is superior/inferior, it&rsquo;s just recognising that you use different techniques for painting with oil compared to water colour.</p>
<p>I tend to adhere to a three-act-structure, with mapped out plot points and character arcs, though before I start I only have a vague idea on the high and low points. <a href="http://www.writehacked.com/writing/learn-structure-novel-five-minutes/">This article by K.M. Weiland</a> simplifies the plot points, and that (along with a general idea on where the characters are going) tends to be where I start my first draft. It often also changes, but I can be almost certain that the points I set as &ldquo;plot points&rdquo; do happen. They just might end up a lot less important than I originally imagined.</p>
<p>I generally do a close PoV, so any steps about the point of view assumes that it&rsquo;s not omniscient, or shallow. This includes both character voices (as in dialogue) and narrative voices (as in how they perceive their world).</p>
<p>Beta readers are, in my opinion, key to any author. They&rsquo;re a nice check, and you can use them at almost any stage, as long as you clarify which stage you&rsquo;re at, and what you&rsquo;re wanting out of the beta reading. I feel that you should aim for 2-3 rounds of beta readers before querying, and that it&rsquo;s a good idea to get a diverse group. This is especially true if your story includes marginalized characters; try to get people who belong to the particular group(s) (if you don&rsquo;t) to give input.</p>
<p>Each of these steps can be repeated, obviously. Some even have a built-in loop. I do them in this order because, to me, that&rsquo;s most logical. You do you!</p>
<h2>Steps summary</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve divided the steps into three different sections.</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing. After this section you should have all the scenes you need in place, and every scene should be useful and add to the story</li>
<li>Narrative. This goes through point of view, consistency and pacing. You should have a compelling, coherent story after that section</li>
<li>Language. The icing on the cake, with themes, motifs, narrative voice and, yes, spelling/grammar</li>
</ol>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Words on paper, aka &ldquo;First Draft&rdquo;</li>
<li>First read through, removing scenes that don&rsquo;t add to the story you&rsquo;re wanting to tell</li>
<li>For each story/character arc, evaluate what scenes are missing. Decide approximate length and see how the story needs to be rebalanced in terms of word count</li>
<li>For each scene, evaluate the scene/sequel structure and ensure the goals (note, not character goals) of the scene are met</li>
</ol>
<h3>Narrative</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fix errors in consistency, such as foreshadowing, timeline faults or factual errors</li>
<li>For each character, ensure consistency in their reaction and development, both for those with a clear character arc and those without</li>
<li>Evaluate scenes on paragraph level, with point of view limitations and Motivation-Reaction Units, including expanding senses</li>
<li>Pacing, which is on a scene level but going into paragraphs/sentences for rhythm and balance</li>
<li>Chapter/Act division, which looks at getting your scenes in order, and your arbitrary story-divisions set up, with hooks in the beginning/end</li>
</ol>
<h3>Language</h3>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate and expand on themes and motifs</li>
<li>For each character, evaluate their dialogue, sentence by sentence</li>
<li>For each point of view, ensure their narrative voice is appropriate</li>
<li>Remove filter words</li>
<li>Spelling- and grammar check. Hemingway app is nice for language structure <strong>suggestions</strong></li>
<li>Repeat step 3 from the Narrative, keeping in mind the pacing from step 4</li>
<li>Evaluate the rhythm on each unit (word/sentence/etc)</li>
</ol>
