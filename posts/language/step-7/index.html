    <h2>Theory</h2>
<p>Stories are meant to be read out loud. Word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence, scene-by-scene, chapter-by-chapter: ensure that you are using the appropriate word, etc. Are you using weak verbs with (or without!) adverbs? Are you using convoluted synonyms to avoid a verb + adverb?</p>
<h3>Own your words</h3>
<p>I was unsure on where to put this tangent, but this seems the fitting place for a few disjointed thoughts on what the right word is.</p>
<p>First, the frenemy of any writer: the thesaurus. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with using a thesaurus to find the perfect word, however you shouldn&rsquo;t go overboard with it. Ensure that you pick words that you (and your PoV!) understand and can use in a sentence. Do you actually know how to use <strong>pernickety</strong>? And would your character use it in dialogue or narrative? If so, go ahead. If you don&rsquo;t, either find a better word, or research the meaning, synonyms <strong>and etymology</strong> of it before you use it.</p>
<p>Next up, problematic words. This is a lot harder, and goes back to knowing the meaning and the etymology of the words you&rsquo;re using, to do your best to avoid furthering bad stereotypes. As an example, let us go with a series of words that all have some meaning of &ldquo;swindle&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyp, gip, jip: probably from the term gypsy&ndash;which is an often offensive term for a member of the Romani people&ndash;meaning to swindle someone. It&rsquo;s based on the stereotype that Roma are swindlers</li>
<li>Jew: etymology fairly clear, meaning to defraud someone</li>
<li>Welsh: once again, etymology fairly clear, meaning is to &ldquo;swindle by defaulting on a debt&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these words are xenophobic, derived from negative stereotypes of a particular group of people. If you use them willy-nilly, you will be furthering those stereotypes, and at least one of your readers are likely to react negatively. Those kind of words are what&rsquo;s referred to as &ldquo;microaggressions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Language is powerful, and it&rsquo;s been used to shape a narrative for many years against groups that are so-called outside the norm. Look up your words, ensure you know and understand them.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Read it again and again. Test the rhythm, check your words, find the perfect word at the perfect place for every bit of the story. If you have someone who&rsquo;d listen, that is immensely helpful.</p>
