### Theory
Filter words are things that either a) doesn't add anything to the narrative, or b) actively adds a barrier between the Point of View and the reader. I recommend removing any word that doesn't add to either the rhythm or clarifies the meaning, though unless you have a list of words to search through your manuscript, wait with it until step 3.7 when you're going through the sentences with a fine-toothed comb.

I use Rayne Hall's book *The Word-Loss Diet* for this, as well as trying to compile a list of words for myself.

#### Adding nothing
Consider the word *then*, such as in "if there's a will, then there's a way". That sentence can be written as: "if there's a will, there's a way", and won't lose any meaning. You can also consider words such as *really*, *very*, *totally*, *so*. If they're used as an intensifier, does that say anything that the item itself doesn't?

#### Barrier between Point of View and reader
Anything that reminds the reader that they're reading a narrative can jolt them out of the story. Examples of those filter words:

* to see (if it's visually described, they can see it)
* to hear (if it's audible described, they can hear it)
* to think (just write the thought)
* to touch (if it's tactily described, they can touch it)
* to wonder (just write the thought)
* to realise (just write the realisation)
* to watch (it's often assumed that in dialogue one will watch the other)
* to look (it's often assumed that in dialogue one will look at the other)
* to seem (acceptable if it's a conclusion about another person who's mind you can't read)
* to feel (or feel like) (describe how they're feeling instead, unless it's about someone else)
* can (just do it)
* to decide (just write their decision)
* to sound (or sound like) (describe how they're sounding instead, unless it's about someone else)
* to start/begin (just do it)

Of course, there's exceptions even beyond the ones I mentioned in my notes above. Maybe the importance lies in the tactile sensation, or in the decision, etc. That's fine, just try to avoid using them without good cause.

#### Adverbs

There is nothing inherently wrong with adverbs, they're an important part of a writer's toolbox. However, they are often used when you should be using a stronger verb instead.

### Practice
Search through your manuscript for the filter words and rephrase to remove them.

When it comes to adverbs, just look for -ly one by one and revise each sentence there. That removes a lot of the effort from the future changing of wordings.
