### Theory
I don't think that too much theory is needed behind dividing your story into chapters or acts, but I'll run through how I think.

First, you don't need chapters or acts or anything like that, unless you want there to be and the story wants them. For novels I generally use chapters, but acts/books/whatever-you-want-to-call-them are a larger segmentation that may or may not help the structure of what you're wanting to tell. We've talked about acts before, but note that there doesn't need to be a correlation between the "acts" of your structure, and the "acts" of your story. You can have three acts where the first ends with the first plot point and the third starts with the third plot point, or you can have only two, etc, etc.

Second, the length of the chapters are irrelevant. You can have long chapters and short chapters and mixed-length chapters. What's important is the story.

You will probably need to rewrite the beginning/ends of each chapter once you've decided on the division, to make sure they flow properly, and that the end of the prior chapter leads the reader into the beginning of the next, without being a good place to put down the book. In the resources I've linked to an article by John Yeoman on several ways to keep the reader hooked.

### Practice
Divide the scenes in whichever way is necessary, then go to work with writing the beginning/end hooks. Keep in mind the pacing of the scene so that the hooks doesn't mess it up. Unless, of course, you want the pacing to be mixed up--maybe picking up the speed in the last paragraph to lead into the following, action-filled chapter?

Oh, and don't end a chapter with a character going to bed, unless there's something else to entice the reader to read on.
