## Theory
It's personal to figure out how much you plan, and how much you let the story/characters drive you. I tend to start with some kind of concept, idea or character, and from there ask "what if ...?" until I have enough of a story to start writing.

Sometimes I won't have enough of a story to start writing until I've written a few scenes, but that's acceptable as well! I prefer to have a bit more of a structure than just explore what'll happen next, but if the story takes a while to shape in your mind, there's worse ways to handle it than writing.

As for structure, I mainly need to have an idea on where the story is going. I try to at least map out the Inciting Event, the Key Event, the three plot points and the climax before I start writing.

## Practice

Now it's time to write! I write scene-by-scene and don't organise into chapters until the end of the Narrative section. I do this to leave the structure as open as possible, so I don't end up feeling "locked in".

Fun fact, for my first novel, I'd read this nice article on what the first chapter needed to contain, and I had made sure that everything in it fitted perfectly. And then I had to cut out 3/4ths to cut the beginning as close to the, well, beginning as possible. That's why I wait with organising into chapters.

## Tips & Tricks

Feeling stuck? Write 1st person, past tense stories from each major character's PoV, and maybe even some of the minor ones. Since this is them telling you the story, don't worry about info dumping or anything like that, since it'll help you get in under their skin.
