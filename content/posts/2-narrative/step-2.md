### Practice
Didn't we do this in step 1.3-4?

Yes and no. In those steps we made sure that the arcs were as they should. Here we make sure that every character, whether they have a written arc or not, reacts in a logical and coherent manner.

**Example 1:** I have a very cool, calculated character. She doesn't take nonsense from anyone, and is quite capable of handling her own battles. Yet, in one scene where her drunken ex is calling her names, she shrinks back like a wilting violet, hiding behind her big, strong Love Interest. Nope. That didn't fit at all, so in the rewrite she handles her ex, and snaps at the Love Interest when he tries to save her. She leaves the interaction annoyed, but not freaked out.

**Example 2:** Same character does, however, have a few scenes where she panics for what seems like no reason. Those stayed in the narrative, what gives?

Simple: You need to know the character's reactions, and you need to understand them. It's okay if the readers don't immediate understand why situation X got this reaction, but similar situation Y didn't, as long as you do. It needs to be consistent for the character, with their experiences, and where they are in their development. If you don't know how they should react, then find out.

### Tips & Tricks

If you have Scrivener, you can use the Keywords to only select the documents where this character is present.
