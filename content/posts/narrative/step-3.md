### Theory
First you need to understand **Motivation-Reaction Units**. For more comprehensive details, check the resources at the end. Like the **Scene-Sequel Pattern**, **Motivation-Reaction Units** (MRU for short) were codified by Dwight V. Swain. Everything that happens can be broken down into two pieces: **Motivation** (which is something that happens) and **Reaction** (which is how the PoV acts based on the prior Motivation). Simpler put: Motivation is the cause, and Reaction is the effect following the cause.

The theory behind this is that it needs to come in the right order.

1. Motivation
2. Reaction, with the following responses (not all of which need to be present, but which need to be in order)
    1. Feeling/thought
    2. Action (including involuntary physical response such as heart racing)
    3. Speech

Example:

*Motivation:*

> "I'd love to go with you to the dance." A smile played on Jayne's lips.

*Reaction:*

> We're going to the dance! (thought). My skin flush with excitement (action). "Alright! I'll pick you up at seven, okay?"

### Practice

Each paragraph now needs to be gone over.

1. Is it necessary? Only you can decide. If it isn't necessary, cut it.
2. Is the PoV perceiving things that's beyond them? This is mainly an issue with a limited PoV, obviously, but you don't want your blindfolded character to see that someone's walking into the room (though they may hear), or the hard-of-hearing character picking up on a whisper on the other side of the room, etc. They also can't *know* that the person they're talking to is hungry, though they might *guess* based on body language or dialogue.
3. Is the PoV deep enough? Are you using enough senses to build a vibrant image? Sight, while easy to describe, is the weakest, and you're not writing a movie. Let your readers smell the decay of the dungeon, hear the dripping from the tap, and experience bare feet digging into wet soil.
4. Is it a Motivation or a Reaction? Both of these can be more than one paragraph, as a note, and might also be a single paragraph with both. Once you've decided where it fits, order the sentences/paragraphs properly. Note, MRUs aren't a law, and occasionally it is far more interesting to introduce a Reaction before a Motivation is perceived by the reader.
