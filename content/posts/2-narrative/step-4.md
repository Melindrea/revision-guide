### Theory
This is on a scene level, but goes into paragraph/sentence to fine-tune it. I'd start with marking up each scene with a keyword on what the pacing is supposed to be (in my case using Scrivener's meta data). I have the following pacing words:

* Urgent/Normal/Ponderous: These are steady, using techniques to suggest the pacing it's using.
* Crescendo: Slower to faster, likely Ponderous -> Normal, or Normal -> Urgent, though the full Ponderous -> Urgent might be doable.
* Diminuendo: Opposite of Crescendo.
* Rollercoaster: Pace is specific to this scene. Maybe it's supposed to start out Ponderous, then set the heart racing, and slow down to Normal.

Mix these up. A story with only Ponderous/Normal scenes is going to feel incredibly dragging. A story with only Urgent scenes are going to have the reader need to put the story down to rest. In theory, Scenes are likely to be on the faster spectrum and Sequels on the slower, but that is not a rule at all. Do the pacing that's necessary for your story.

### Practice
For a slower/less urgent pace, use:

* Descriptions
* Longer/more complex sentence
* Extended dialogue
* Longer scenes
* Longer paragraphs
* Showing
* Detailed reaction

For a more urgent pace, use:

* Condensed descriptions; cut them down to a minimum
* Short, snappy sentences
* Less dialogue, and shorter sentences/action beats
* Telling
* Mixing shorter and longer paragraphs

Each sentence should still be necessary, even in a slower pace, but in the more urgently-paced sections, be even harsher in what you let through. Focus on key elements to build up the setting. In a more ponderous Sequel, you can probably afford to describe the soil under their feet, as well as the scent of gunfire in the air, and the taste of blood in their mouth, but in a tense scene, decide which one of these is most poignant. What will paint the clearest picture in the shortest amount of words?

I often write characters who suffer from anxiety, and with that I enjoy using a diminuendo/crescendo pace (depending on whether they're starting or ending up anxious). When their heart races and they're short of breath, paragraphs are often only 2-3 sentences. When they're calmer, they become longer and more complex.

Once you've finished this section, you should have a compelling, coherent story with a nice pace that will set the reader's hearts racing at times, and at other times allow them the breathe and relax.
