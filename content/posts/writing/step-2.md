## Theory
Have you ever read an article stating that every word-sentence-scene needs to work for its place in your story? That's quite true. You shouldn't have anything in the story that doesn't add to the narrative and further the story.

But, what does that actually mean? Should you remove every scene where nothing directly related to the plot happens? No, far from. The key point is *narrative*. What adds to the narrative?

Scenes ...

* That foreshadow/mirror future scenes
* Where actual plot happens
* Where we learn things that are key to something else, like that the character is allergic to strawberries **if that's relevant later**
* That foreshadow/are plot relevant to scenes in later stories in a series

Which ones don't?

* Shooting the breeze. If there is just a single nugget of info, see if you can incorporate it in a different place
* Scenes relevant to subplots that were skipped in the end

In the end, you are the person to decide if a scene adds or not. Character development is as important, if not more, so don't skimp on that, but don't keep things that are boring.

### Jami Gold's Elements of a Good Scene Checklist
In the resources I'll share a link to Jami Gold's worksheet for several scenes, but the checklist for a single scene is also good. Yes, some of the things mentioned here I mentioned above, which is why I added it.

Note, in my view, "action" doesn't necessarily mean violence, just that something's happening. Also, many of these things will be deepening in future revision. If you want to keep a scene, note what it's lacking, and come back to it.

Each scene should reveal **at least one** of the following:
* A plot point
* A character's goal
* Action to advance the plot
* Action to increase the tension

Each scene should also reveal **at least two** of the following:
* Character development
* A cause of character conflict
* An effect of character conflict
* How stakes are raised
* A reinforcmenet of the stakes
* Character motivation

Each scene can also reveal:
* Character backstory
* World building
* The story's tone or mood
* Story theme
* Foreshadowing

## Practice

Mark up if you think a scene needs to be Rewritten (and if so, what needs to be fixed), Deleted or Kept. I tend to delete the to-be-deleted scenes immediately, but I know others who puts them in a specific pile, in case they can be reused.
