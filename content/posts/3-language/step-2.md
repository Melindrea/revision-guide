### Practice
For each character (no matter how minor--this is when it's good to have added keywords for every recurring character in the scenes), evaluate their dialogue. They should be:

1. Distinct. This means that when looking at a line, you should immediately know whether it's Character A or Character B (within reason, obviously). See if you can find some way to help show that it's this character. For instance, one of my characters speaks with asides, so her dialogue is littered with "I talked to X yesterday--you remember X? We went to school together--and he said ...". Other quirks can include specific sayings, or just that they have different vocabularies. The voice should fit each character, but don't base it off of stereotype, but *rather the specific character*.
2. Consistent. Unless there's a reason for a change in speech pattern, it should be enforced throughout.
