### Practice
You should by now have a complete story with few plot holes, though you still have a long way to go. If you need to go back to prior steps, that's fine, but in the ideal world you shouldn't.

First step here is to read through the story carefully and jot down notes for yourself. What do you need to fact check? What contradicts itself? How's the timeline holding up? Did you remember to introduce the Mother that gives the final clue *before* she waltzes onto the stage? And please tell me the heroine didn't magically get, well ... magic without anything foreshadowing it?

True story: I'd written the first draft, started going through the timeline and realise that based on my set timing, there's Christmas and New Years that apparently my characters didn't celebrate. Funny that!

Once you've noted all of the things you need to fix in consistency, find out what you need, plot out new Scenes and Sequels if you need to, and get all of those details down in their right place.
